**Build secure, isolated code execution environments on Cloudflare.**

The Cloudflare Sandbox SDK lets you run untrusted code safely in isolated containers. Execute commands, manage files, run background processes, and expose services — all from your Workers applications.

Perfect for AI code execution, interactive development environments, data analysis platforms, CI/CD systems, and any application that needs secure code execution at the edge.

## Use cases

### AI code execution

Give AI models the ability to write and execute code safely. Perfect for:
- AI agents that need to run Python for data analysis
- Code generation tools that validate outputs
- Interactive coding assistants

### Development environments

Build cloud-based IDEs and development tools:
- Browser-based code editors
- Interactive tutorials and learning platforms
- Code playgrounds and REPLs

### Data analysis platforms

Run user-submitted data processing code:
- Jupyter-style notebook environments
- Custom data transformation pipelines
- Statistical analysis tools

### CI/CD systems

Execute build and test workflows:
- Automated testing environments
- Build systems for user projects
- Deployment automation

## How it works

The Sandbox SDK is built on Cloudflare's container platform and uses Durable Objects to manage sandbox lifecycle:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a sandbox">
    Your Worker gets a reference to a sandbox using `getSandbox()`. Each sandbox is backed by a Durable Object that manages the container lifecycle.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute code">
    Call methods like `exec()`, `writeFile()`, or `runCode()` to interact with the sandbox. The SDK communicates with the container runtime over HTTP.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get results">
    Receive execution results, file contents, or streamed output back in your Worker.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic lifecycle">
    Containers hibernate when idle and wake up on demand. State persists across requests.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Architecture

```
Worker → Sandbox Durable Object → Container Runtime → Shell/Filesystem
```

- **Worker**: Your application code that calls the SDK
- **Sandbox Durable Object**: Manages container lifecycle and routes requests
- **Container Runtime**: Bun-based HTTP server running inside Docker containers
- **Shell/Filesystem**: Ubuntu 22.04 with Python 3.11, Node.js 20, Git, and common utilities

## What's included

Each sandbox container comes pre-installed with:

- **Python 3.11** with matplotlib, numpy, pandas, and ipython
- **Node.js 20 LTS** with npm
- **Bun 1.x** runtime
- **Git** for repository operations
- **Common utilities**: curl, wget, jq, and more

You can also use custom Docker images to add your own tools and dependencies.

## Quick example

```typescript
import { getSandbox, type Sandbox } from '@cloudflare/sandbox';

export { Sandbox } from '@cloudflare/sandbox';

type Env = {
  Sandbox: DurableObjectNamespace<Sandbox>;
};

export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
    const sandbox = getSandbox(env.Sandbox, 'my-sandbox');
    
    // Execute Python code
    const result = await sandbox.exec('python3 -c "print(2 + 2)"');
    
    return Response.json({ 
      output: result.stdout,
      success: result.success 
    });
  }
};
```

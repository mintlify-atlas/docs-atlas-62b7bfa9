## Examples

### Delete a file

```typescript
const result = await sandbox.deleteFile('/workspace/temp.txt');
console.log(result.success); // true
```

### Delete a directory

```typescript
// Deletes directory and all its contents
await sandbox.deleteFile('/workspace/old-project');
```

### Safe deletion with existence check

```typescript
const exists = await sandbox.exists('/workspace/temp.txt');
if (exists.exists) {
  await sandbox.deleteFile('/workspace/temp.txt');
  console.log('File deleted');
} else {
  console.log('File does not exist');
}
```

### Delete multiple files

```typescript
const filesToDelete = [
  '/workspace/file1.txt',
  '/workspace/file2.txt',
  '/workspace/file3.txt'
];

for (const file of filesToDelete) {
  await sandbox.deleteFile(file);
}
```

### Cleanup temporary files

```typescript
// List and delete all .tmp files
const result = await sandbox.listFiles('/workspace', { recursive: true });
const tempFiles = result.files.filter(
  file => file.type === 'file' && file.name.endsWith('.tmp')
);

for (const file of tempFiles) {
  await sandbox.deleteFile(file.absolutePath);
}
console.log(`Deleted ${tempFiles.length} temporary files`);
```

## Error Handling

The method throws an error if:
- The file or directory does not exist
- Insufficient permissions to delete
- The path is invalid or protected

```typescript
try {
  await sandbox.deleteFile('/workspace/important.txt');
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to delete file:', error.message);
}
```

## Notes

- **Deletion is permanent** - there is no recycle bin or undo
- Deleting a directory removes all its contents recursively
- Protected system paths cannot be deleted
- Use [exists](/api/list-files) to check before deleting if needed
